# Movie_Sales_Analysis
Movie Sales Analysis is a Power BI project using IMDb data to study box office revenue, ratings, votes, genres, directors, and yearly trends. The dashboard reveals key performance drivers, top movies, popular genres, and audience behavior to support data-driven insights.

🎬 Project Overview (Explanation)

This project uses IMDb movie data to study how movies perform at the box office. It focuses on understanding revenue generation, audience ratings, voting patterns, genre popularity, director performance, and yearly trends. Power BI is used to convert raw data into interactive dashboards that make analysis easy and insightful.

🎯 Objective (Explanation)
1. Analyze movie performance across years

This helps identify growth or decline trends in movie releases, revenue, ratings, and votes over time.

2. Identify top-performing movies, genres, and directors

This helps understand which movies earn the most, which genres are most profitable, and which directors consistently deliver success.

3. Study the relationship between ratings, votes, runtime, and revenue

This analysis checks whether higher ratings and more votes actually lead to higher revenue and whether runtime affects movie success.

4. Provide data-driven insights into box office performance

Instead of assumptions, the project uses facts and visuals to explain why some movies perform better than others.
